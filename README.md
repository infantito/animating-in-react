# [How to Animate Your React App]
## Dev: [Daniel Infante]



If you want to add some life and engagement to your React app, animation is a great way to do it. 

In this demo, I've learned how to add some sparkle to a web app with simple animations. Also I built a basic to-do app, and then enhance it with UI animation. To start, I learned how to use React's built-in animation hooks. After I've become proficient with that, I moved on to react-motion, a very popular and powerful animation library.

## Source Files Description

The demo contains the complete To Do application with react-motion animation. To begin, run `npm install` then `npm start` to serve the application locally.
